# IoT Drone Fire Detection

This project is a university assignment focused on developing an IoT-based drone fire detection system. The goal is to leverage drone technology and Python-based software to detect fires efficiently, providing early alerts and potentially aiding in disaster management.

## Overview

The IoT Drone Fire Detection project integrates drone hardware with Python software to perform real-time fire detection. The system utilises sensors and camera input, the data collected by the drone is then analysed to identify fire hazards, and alerts can be sent to relevant authorities or systems for rapid response.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidf-2002/IoT_Drone_Fire_Detection.git
cd IoT_Drone_Fire_Detection
```

### 2. Install Requirements

The project uses several dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Other Requirements

- Make sure you have the required permissions and drivers for your drone and sensors.
- For image/video-based detection, ensure your system has the required camera modules and OpenCV (or similar) installed.
- If using additional IoT modules (such as MQTT brokers, cloud services, or dashboards), configure them before running the software.

**Note:** There may be additional requirements depending on your hardware (such as libraries for camera or sensor interfacing). Please refer to the relevant hardware documentation and ensure all device drivers and SDKs are properly installed.
